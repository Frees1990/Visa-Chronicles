            <h3><strong>Hi! I'm Fair Rees,</strong></h3>
            <p>Like you, I struggled to cope with the stress of processing my spouse visa to the UK. I have been through too
                manay sites to gather as much information about the process to secure a Spouse Visa to the UK and each one of
                them directs me to the Gov.UK website which only gave me confusing information about the process. I have created
                this blog to help you navigate through the process and guide you through it with videos and Form images that you
                can follow along with. If my blog still can't answer your visa quiries click the Facebook icon below and join
                our Filipino Community Page in the UK where you can post your questions and someone with the same visa category
                might be able to help you. Are you ready? click the buttom below.
