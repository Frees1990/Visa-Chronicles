                        <p>There are numerous ways to satisfy the English language requirement.</p>

                                However, if the applicant’s English can be described as ‘intermediate’ or ‘advanced’, it is recommended that they take the ‘A2’ or ‘B1’ test, despite the A1 test being required for a spouse visa.
                                This is because if the applicant relies on an A2 English language test for their first spouse visa application, this will prevent them from having to do the test again for the subsequent FLR M visa in the UK (which requires a test at A2 level or above).
                                If the applicant relies on a B1 English language test for their first or second spouse visa application, they will normally be able to rely on the same test to meet the English language requirement for the Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) application.
                                Applicants will normally be awarded an English language test certificate once they have passed the Secure English language test.
                                This English language test certificate will contain a SELT unique reference number (URN) which will be required as part of your spouse visa application (if you rely on the English language test to satisfy the English language requirement).
