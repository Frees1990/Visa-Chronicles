# Visa Chronicles

My aim for this website is to help my fellow Filipino Citizen Mena and Women obtain their Spouse Visa to reunite to the person they love. Obtaining a spouse visa can be a tedious and heartbreaking process but would all be worth it in the end. I am hoping that this website will be a helpful guide for interacial couple go through the process of their Visa Application smoothly and to also prepare them to the life in UK.

...! This is where I put the photo of my web design...
